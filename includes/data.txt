Also on pt-141 i think you show me last time 1 question that was what drug do you use i'll look into it on monday
Also for now there is by default revoke subscription option is available but later we will only show it on monaday on disqualify only 
by creating an action item its a quick thing i'll do it on monday
For now testing please do not left any post funnel question blank means not choosn we will add required logic to all. to fix conditional logic we have remove that
for sermolin i face an error (Order Creating Error: Error: ValidationError: expiresAt: Path `expiresAt` is required.\) we will fix it





i need to ask telegra some questions
1) expiresAt error when i try to create order using sermorelin medication
2) how we can test the prescription approved webhooks
3) is there any webhook that's documentation is not available in telegra docs? 
4) when we will again create an order does we require questionnaire to resubmit
5) Does the postfunnel follow up questionnaire automatically come upon next order?  or after specific duration also how i can test that
6) If we will create next order does all the questionnaire we need to submit again i think no. if this is the answer tell me how much time those questionnarie will be valid
7) if an order is place for 3 months how to tell telegra that this order is placed for 3 months? 
8) in telegra does doctor always visit each month?  
9) Which pharmacy events do you have?
