Its not going back when moved to checkout page if the user is already login in prefunnel either that's GLP prefunnel or may be other prefunnel
on prefunnel login page fix the hover color of the button and QA the functionality


-- password is sent openly in login page
-- on login page when we click on sign in with google it displays a border non rounded border so need to fix that 
-- signup button hover color need to be fixed
-- need to add sidebar popup of login
-- on my Account do not need to show the My Account buton in the main navbar
-- On Shipping Address of patient dashboard display zipcode, city and state etc display complete address and any instructions related to shipping information of his medication if possible
-- On openeing another prefunnel if already available the shipping information just display those information instead of let him retyping the whole.
-- the subscription was created but when i see in orders i do not find any order detail that's scary
-- if due to any reason on prefunnel click order failed means create order failed then we should handle that no subscription should be created and even no need to create that patient to telegra
-- on fluent form when we navigate to next steps the form flicker when too many steps skip in conditional logic you can give fixed height
-- BMI class initialize twice due to next button not showing when page refresh so i set a timer also on other plans no need to initilaize the class if there are no fields
-- Need to add links at privacy policy  and terms and conditions in upload glp  agreement concent in action item 
-- On checkout when we refresh it do not loads the summary details but when we do click on back button it then shows everything correctly it looks that on page refresh getAmount function do not called when user on checkout page
-- we also need to only send sms if user click that yes i prefer to recieve updates
-- we should only save the patient information if not already save saving the already patient information again and again does not make sense
-- prevent action that if form is prefunnel he should not reach to submit questionnare or prepare questionnare code that is in after fluent form submit hook.
-- if order create failed we do not need to charge do not need to create order and do not need to do anything
-- we should pass no symptoms
-- make it dynamic quinstn id 
-- add disqualify for states in nad-therapy
-- need to add loading bar with hld_form_wrap_hidden so on page loads we can show loading bar we can
--  on prefunnel login page the errors are displayed on alert which is not nice. we can display errors below input fieds to enhance the user experience
--  at this moment if user fillout prefunnel first we create a subscription but if due to some reason the fluent form become failed the subscription still remain created we should make it not like that
-- make subscriptions data in stripe dynamic especially stripe-create-setup-intent.php
-- first it should display the email field then password for signup
-- Add PHP and more javascript checks those will double check that patient cannot submit any questionnnare based on selections. i see fluent form can mistakenly submit the qeustionnaries
-- on file stripe-create-setup-intent.php file we need to make the plan dynamic  'plan' => 'glp_1_prefunnel',
-- we only need to create subscription and everything else on telegra if patietns payment successfull.
-- improve the design of purchased subscription and add more relevant data and professional options
-- we need to fix medication issue specially on page refresh etc
-- need to fix the loader issue completely
-- on prefunnel now its signup we need to make a way to sign in in easy way
-- tighten the security of if (!isset($form['form_type']))  in before insert hook for disqualifier checks
-- display correct type of error message in prefunnel signup page
-- NAD medication id did not save to the MySQl subscription table with i create order with ryahtest1@gmail.com
